            <h1>Background</h1>
            <p>CivRealms is a server in a long history of servers belonging to a genre of Minecraft anarchy servers called "Civ". The first was "AncapMinecraft" created by a player named ttk2 in 2011.</p>
            <p>Civ servers play like regular Minecraft, and each have their own unique mechanics, but they share a few mechanics in common:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Little to no admin intervention. Players are expected to police themselves, and the world never resets. There is a spirit of experimentation.</li>
                <li>The server is a virtual world. It remains up 24 hours a day. Other players can interact with the world while you are disconnected.</li>
                <li>Players can indefinitely ban other players from the server by killing them with a special item called a <em>prison pearl</em>.</li>
                <li>Players can make blocks time-consuming to destroy using special items called <em>reinforcements</em>. This makes private property possible, as a players can reinforce chests containing items and the walls of their homes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Starting a city from scratch</h1>
            <p>How do you design a city?</p>
            <p>We designed CivCorp based on several observation about other cities:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Most cities use their land poorly and become ghost cities over time. After an initial wave of excitement, city residents would go inactive and their land would sit unused. Since the founding players often took the most central and valuable land, players who joined late would have to find land on the outskirts, which creates urban sprawl.</li>
                <li>Cities do not have to be big. We want to maximize the number of "places".</li>
                <li>Most players do not want to be told what to do, and it's hard to compel them to do things anyway. Most cities rely on volunteers and lack revenue because taxation is unpopular.</li>
                <li>Cities experience network effects because of positive externalities (when the donut shop opens up next to the cafe, both win).</li>
                <li>Cities experience agglomeration (people want to live in large groups of people). When there are many people in close proximity, transaction costs for many activities shrink, investing in good shops makes more sense, and some new business become possible.</li>
                <li>Most governments are run by incompetent people. They often tend to be cliquish.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>The primary role of the state is to protect its citizens and their property.</p>
            <p>We did this in a variety of ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We established access control by building a wall and trench around the city. Players could access the city through gates on each side of the city only if they were whitelisted. If a non-whitelisted player somehow managed to enter the city, special blocks known as "snitches" would notify whitelisted players of the trespasser. We offered a bounty to anyone who would remove them.</p>
                <li>We very publicly blacklisted and bountied players who harmed players or damaged property in the city, and offered generous compensation to victims.</li>
                <li>We publicly took a position of isolationism, while establishing goodwill with power players on the server.</li>
                <li>We reserved the power to blacklist players and groups from the city, which would make it more difficult for them to participate in the economy.</li>
                <li>We maintained a massive war chest in case we needed to go to war.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Economy</h2>
            <h3>The Exchange</h3>
            <p>eliminating barter</p>
            <p>market making</p>
            <p>manufacturing center/commodity colonies model ("Factorio base", USA)</p>
            <p>coordinated economy of server as invisible hand</p>
            <p>trade with us or get fucked because your economy will grow slower than your enemies</p>
            <p>value of Wall Street is ensuring prices reflect all available information</p>
            <p>controlling supply chain bottlenecks</p>
            <h3>Land Value Tax</h3>
            <p>We knew the Exchange would generate a large amount of value for the land around it, so we wanted to capture that value for ourselves, while also promoting growth.</p>
            <h2>Justice</h2>
            <p>As a voluntary city, we wanted to encourage private contracts.</p>
            <p>We originally tried to use digital signatures.</p>
            <h2>Urban planning</h2>
            <p>We made a mistake by laying out plots like a chess grid. We should have laid them out in streets to make so that each plot has a clear front.</p>

            <h1>Virtual worlds</h1>
            <p>The Metaverse is nothing new. Virtual worlds have been around for a long time (e.g. World of WarCraft, Runescape, Club Penguin). Immersion does not require realism.</p>
            <h2>Virtual education</h2>
            <p>Like a good book that you can revisit over and over to learn new lessons, virtual worlds allow you to rapidly learn new lessons.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The fact that we prefer virtual worlds is a critique of the real world (Reality is Broken).</li>
                <li>Playing in a virtual world as a way to learn about the real world, very different to play and test ideas than to just read. Reading books on politics/economics was like a cheat code.</li>
                <li>Civ is a sandbox. Real life is too, but it doesn't feel like it. You don't really get to play real life until you're financially independent. But even then most people don't think that way.</li>
                <li>Observation that people have a lot of creativity/grand ideas in game worlds that doesn't come through in the real world. Real world has a lot of friction, which is depressing. Why is Civ addictive ("Civ crack") but the real world is not?</li>
            </ul>
