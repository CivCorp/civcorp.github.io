            <h1>Background</h1>
            <p>CivRealms is a server in a long history of servers belonging to a genre of Minecraft anarchy servers called "Civ". The first was "AncapMinecraft" created by a player named ttk2 in 2011.</p>
            <p>Civ servers play like regular Minecraft, and each have their own unique mechanics, but they share a few mechanics in common:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Little to no admin intervention. Players are expected to police themselves, and the world never resets. There is a spirit of experimentation.</li>
                <li>The server is a virtual world. It remains up 24 hours a day. Other players can interact with the world while you are disconnected.</li>
                <li>Players can indefinitely ban other players from the server by killing them with a special item called a <em>prison pearl</em>.</li>
                <li>Players can make blocks time-consuming to destroy using special items called <em>reinforcements</em>. This makes private property possible, as a players can reinforce chests containing items and the walls of their homes.</li>
                <li>The server is a sandbox game. There is no way to win. Players come up with their own goals.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Starting a city from scratch</h1>
            <p>How do you design a city?</p>
            <p>We designed CivCorp based on several observation about other cities:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Most cities use their land poorly and become ghost cities over time. After an initial wave of excitement, city residents would go inactive and their land would sit unused. Since the founding players often took the most central and valuable land, players who joined late would have to find land on the outskirts, which creates urban sprawl.</li>
                <li>Cities do not have to be big. We want to maximize the number of "places".</li>
                <li>Most players do not want to be told what to do, and it's hard to compel them to do things anyway. Most cities rely on volunteers and lack revenue because taxation is unpopular.</li>
                <li>Cities experience network effects because of positive externalities (when the donut shop opens up next to the cafe, both win).</li>
                <li>Cities experience agglomeration (people want to live in large groups of people). When there are many people in close proximity, transaction costs for many activities shrink, investing in good shops makes more sense, and some new business become possible.</li>
                <li>Most governments are run by incompetent people. They often tend to be cliquish.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>The primary role of the state is to protect its citizens and their property.</p>
            <p>We did this in a variety of ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We established access control by building a wall and trench around the city. Players could access the city through gates on each side of the city only if they were whitelisted. If a non-whitelisted player somehow managed to enter the city, special blocks known as "snitches" would notify whitelisted players of the trespasser. We offered a bounty to anyone who would remove them.</p>
                <li>We very publicly blacklisted and bountied players who harmed players or damaged property in the city, and offered generous compensation to victims.</li>
                <li>We publicly took a position of isolationism, while establishing goodwill with power players on the server.</li>
                <li>We reserved the power to blacklist players and groups from the city, which would make it more difficult for them to participate in the economy.</li>
                <li>We maintained a massive war chest in case we needed to go to war.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Economy</h2>
            <h3>The Exchange</h3>
            <p>eliminating barter</p>
            <p>market making</p>
            <p>manufacturing center/commodity colonies model ("Factorio base", USA)</p>
            <p>coordinated economy of server as invisible hand</p>
            <p>trade with us or get fucked because your economy will grow slower than your enemies</p>
            <p>value of Wall Street is ensuring prices reflect all available information</p>
            <p>controlling supply chain bottlenecks</p>
            <h3>Land Value Tax</h3>
            <p>We knew the Exchange would generate a large amount of value for the land around it, so we wanted to capture that value for ourselves, while also promoting growth.</p>
            <h2>Justice</h2>
            <p>As a voluntary city, we wanted to encourage private contracts.</p>
            <p>We originally tried to use digital signatures.</p>
            <h2>Urban planning</h2>
            <p>We made a mistake by laying out plots like a chess grid. We should have laid them out in streets to make so that each plot has a clear front.</p>
            <p>CivCorp Tower (architecture is design of space not buildings, so let people design spaces (cubes); Habbo Hotel-style hyperlinked rooms; cities don’t actually need much space, all production/trading could fit in a single plot, so ownership of space is mostly status driven or a way to park wealth)</p>

            <h1>Capitalism</h1>
            <h2>Why capitalism is good</h2>
            <p>Why (non-monopoly) capitalism is efficient (puts all resources (labor, capital, land) to best use). See Asian Tigers (Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong) + Gilded Age. Compare to monopoly capitalism of today. But capitalism/badly designed rules creates opportunities for rent-seeking (virtual real estate). In some ways, this is actually the only way to get rich. But you need to see it first.</p>
            <h2>How to get rich</h2>
            <p>How to get rich (monopoly (via network effects, via cornering a market), Thiel 0 to 1 (competition is for losers), critical thinking/seeing the future/seeing the big picture and how you fit into it/developing a thesis (why CivCorp?)/identifying the most important problems (Hamming question), separating time from ability to create value (e.g. trading, scalable things), 1% create all of the wealth). Being a laborer sucks (of all the value you create, after company, taxes, rent, you’re left with very little). Is time working for you or against you?</p>
            <h2>How rich people think</h2>
            <p>How your thinking changes when you do get rich (rich people problems are what to do with all the money, where can it be invested) + Lack of things to invest in/bottleneck on ideas, why is it hard to come up with investable ideas. What is capital really? In real world, our economy has the same issue which is a good thing if you’re not rich- bottleneck is ideas not capital</p>
            <h2>Casino</h2>
            <p>I designed some slot machines and built a small casino in the center of the city. I learned that they make an enormous amount of money, but mostly because there are a small number of people who have issues with gambling. After losing money, many people believe that if they just play a little more they can win it back and go home having broke even, but the math is against them.</p>

            <h1>Virtual worlds</h1>
            <p>The Metaverse is nothing new. Virtual worlds have been around for a long time (e.g. World of WarCraft, Runescape, Club Penguin). Immersion does not require realism.</p>
            <h2>Virtual education</h2>
            <p>Like a good book that you can revisit over and over to learn new lessons, virtual worlds allow you to rapidly learn new lessons.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The fact that we prefer virtual worlds is a critique of the real world (Reality is Broken).</li>
                <li>Playing in a virtual world as a way to learn about the real world, very different to play and test ideas than to just read. Reading books on politics/economics was like a cheat code.</li>
                <li>Civ is a sandbox. Real life is too, but it doesn't feel like it. You don't really get to play real life until you're financially independent. But even then most people don't think that way.</li>
                <li>Observation that people have a lot of creativity/grand ideas in game worlds that doesn't come through in the real world. Real world has a lot of friction, which is depressing. Why is Civ addictive ("Civ crack") but the real world is not?</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Virtual economy</h2>
            <p>Evolution of money (diamonds versus stamina, two-currency systems)</p>
            <p>Issues with creating fiat currency.</p>
            <p>Lack of wealth sinks leads to stagnation. Accelerationism.</p>
            <p>No way to convert wealth to force.</p>
