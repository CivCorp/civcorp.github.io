            <h1>Background</h1>
            <p>CivRealms is a server in a long history of servers belonging to a genre of Minecraft anarchy servers called "Civ". The first was "AncapMinecraft" created by a player named ttk2 in 2011.</p>
            <p>Civ servers play like regular Minecraft, and each have their own unique mechanics, but they share a few mechanics in common:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Players police themselves with minimal admin intervention.</li>
                <li>The world never resets.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Economy</h2>
            <h3>The Exchange</h3>

            <p>coordinated economy of server as invisible hand</p>
            <p>trade with us or get fucked because your economy will grow slower than your enemies</p>
            <p>value of Wall Street is ensuring prices reflect all available information</p>
            <p>controlling supply chain bottlenecks</p>
            <h3>Land Value Tax</h3>
            <p>We knew the Exchange would generate a large amount of value for the land around it, so we wanted to capture that value for ourselves.</p>
