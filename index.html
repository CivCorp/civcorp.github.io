    <div class="content">
      <h2>What is CivCorp?</h2>
      <p><strong>CivCorp</strong> is a virtual private corporation on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CivRealms/">CivRealms</a>, founded by TheLoneTopWolfx and MCSPenguin, that operates CivCorp City and uses its capital to facilitate trade on the server. Join our <a href="https://discord.gg/T9vTE46">Discord</a> for more information.</p>
      <h2>What is CivCorp City?</h2>
      <p><strong>CivCorp City</strong> is a trade-oriented city being built and operated by CivCorp. It aims to become the server’s de facto trade hub and one-stop shop.</p>
      <div class="figure">

      </div>
      <h2>Where is CivCorp City located?</h2>
      <p>CivCorp City is located centrally at <strong>4500, -5300</strong>, just northeast of Olendor (Varathia) and 3 minutes southeast of Wheaton (Wheatistan).</p>
      <p>CivCorp City is linked by rail to Olendor (1:20m), Alexandria (7:20m), Amaryllis, ICOR, Norlund, and Wheatistan.</p>
      <h2>How do you get land in CivCorp City?</h2>
      <p>CivCorp City is subdivided into 64 plots which cost money to purchase. You can view a map of the city <a href="https://civcorp.github.io/map">here</a>.</p>
      <div class="gallery">
        <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/648050065159749643/648050473961783317/Screen_Shot_2019-11-23_at_9.58.44_PM.png">
        <img src="https://imgur.com/33BhLi7.jpg">
      </div>
      <p>There are three ways to get a plot in the city:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strike>Buy an empty plot for 20 Stamina.</strike></li>
        <li>Privately buy a claimed plot from a current plot owner.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>To see a map of the claimed and unclaimed plots, <a href="https://civcorp.github.io/map">click here</a>.</p>
      <p>In addition to the purchase price, you must also pay monthly dues on your plot equal to 1/16 of the value of your plot.</p>
      <h2>What can I do with my plot?</h2>
      <p>By buying a plot, you agree to the <a href="https://github.com/CivCorp/Legal/blob/master/PlotOwnershipAgreement.md">Plot Ownership Agreement</a>. The agreement allows you to do anything with your plot except store pearls or build anything that would be reasonably considered a hazard (e.g. traps) or a nuisance (e.g. lag machines or hate symbols). You may also lease or transfer your plot to another player.</p>
      <h2>How big are plots?</h2>
      <p>Central plots are 21x21. Edge plots are 21x19. Corner plots are 19x19. Plots extend from bedrock to sky limit.</p>
      <h2>Why buy a plot in CivCorp City?</h2>
      <h3>CivCorp is going to invest heavily in the city</h3>
      <p>CivCorp, the corporation that manages CivCorp City, only makes money if we improve the value of plots in our city, so we’re strongly incentivized to invest in making the city a desirable place to live and trade. Some highlights:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A flat grid-based layout facilitates easy navigation and plot labeling.</li>
        <li>The single largest shop and exchange on the server in the center of our city (Plot E5)</li>
        <li>A stamina-backed currency to enable fine-grained trade, with the bank in Plot E4.</li>
        <li>Aqua Nether Portal just 90 seconds away by rail.</li>
        <li>A fully-featured factory room in the center of the city (E5) with Blast Furnace, Advanced Experience Factory, Mithril Tools, Mithril Armor, available for a monthly subscription fee.</li>
        <li>Trench and wall around the city, with guaranteed bounties on any raiders.</li>
        <li>Planned rail lines will connect the city to all major metros.</li>
        <li>A shopchest inventory tracking system will let customers see what’s in stock before visiting, and allows shopkeepers to see when it’s time to restock without visiting first.</li>
        <li>Integration with CivMall (civmall.ml) will allow producers to sell their goods online, and buyers to have goods shipped to them. Pickups for anything bought on CivMall will be discounted for residents of the city.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Your neighbors will be productive</h3>
      <p>Ever been frustrated by seeing a plot you didn't think was being used well? And when you offered to buy it, you got rejected? CivCorp City is structured to never allow that to happen. The city will stay dense and avoid sprawl, keeping shops and services close together.</p>
      <p>CivCorp charges monthly dues on its plots, designed to encourage its members to put their plots to their most productive use. These dues will increase over time as the demand for and value of plots increases, so people who don’t use their plots productively will be pushed to relocate to less valuable locations, and people who do want to use their plots productively will have access to the best plots. Monthly dues start at just 1/16th of the purchase price of the plot, so if you buy a plot for 20 Stamina, dues will be just over 1 Stamina per month.</p>
      <p>Any increase in dues comes with a corresponding buyout offer; if dues increase by 50%, you can instead sell your plot back to us for 50% more than you paid. (For fans of economics, our policies were heavily influenced by Milton Friedman and Henry George.)</p>
      <p>If you want to live in a city where all of your neighbors are active power players utilizing their plots for useful shops or services, then you should buy a plot in CivCorp City.</p>
      <h3>Plots are an investment</h3>
      <p>CivCorp City plots are an investment. As the value of plots in the city improve over time, you will have the opportunity to sell your plot for more than you bought it, making this one of the few investable opportunities on the server. Also, no new plots will ever be created!</p>
      <h3>Competent leadership</h3>
      <p>CivCorp was founded by MCSPenguin, TheLoneTopWolfx, and Convoy, some of the most experienced traders on any Civ server.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>MCSPenguin, also known as EliteTurtle, opened the Nether Emporium in Olendor and the Purple Shop in Alexandria, and has become one of the most active traders on the server. He likes to design efficient usable spaces and has been terraforming and laying out the city. In real life, he is a software engineer in his mid-twenties.</li>
        <li>TheLoneTopWolfx is a long-time trader on Civ servers, dating back to Devoted 2.0. He spends much of his time thinking about how to build new types of shops and how to make shops more secure (with explanations at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civeconomics/">/r/civeconomics</a>). He built the Civ Mercantile Exchange (CME) in Mt. Augusta, the largest shop on CivClassics. In real life, he is a software engineer in his late-twenties.</li>
        <li>Convoy is the richest player on the server, de facto warden of the server, and owner of the server’s only serious pearl vault.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>CivCorp leadership is organized as a corporation. The current CEO is MCSPenguin, and the Board of Directors consists of MCSPenguin, TheLoneTopWolfx, Convoy, esorscher, and Posey.</li>
    <h2>What are the laws of CivCorp City?</h2>
    <p>CivCorp City follows <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CivConcord/comments/48wo6g/civcrafters_law/">CivCrafter Common Law (CCL)</a>:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Do not steal another person’s or entity's digital property.</li>
      <li>Do not destroy another person’s or entity's digital property.</li>
      <li>Do not attack or capture others unless it is in self-defense or in defense of one's digital property.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Failure to observe these laws will result in being banned from the city or being pearled.</p>
    <p>CivCorp officers <em>will</em> pursue lawful bounties. Bounty hunters pursuing lawful bounties are welcome to pursue them in the city.</p>
