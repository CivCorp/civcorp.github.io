              <h2>What is CivCorp City?</h2>
              <p><strong>CivCorp City</strong> is a trade-oriented city being built and operated by CivCorp. It aims to become the server’s de facto trade hub and one-stop shop.</p>
              <p>CivCorp City is located centrally at <strong>4500, -5300</strong>, just northeast of Olendor (Varathia) and 3 minutes southeast of Wheaton (Wheatistan).</p>

              <h2>How do you get land in CivCorp City?</h2>
              <p>CivCorp City is subdivided into 64 plots which cost money to purchase. You can view a map of the city <a href="https://civcorp.github.io/map">here</a>.</p>
              <p>There are multiple ways to get a plot in the city:</p>
              <ol>
                <li><strike>Buy an empty plot for 20 Stamina.</strike></li>
                <li>Privately buy a claimed plot from an existing plot owner.</li>
                <li>Rent land from an existing plot owner.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Plot owners can use their plots for any purpose except storing the pearls of captured players or building anything that would be reasonably considered a hazard (e.g. traps) or a nuisance (e.g. lag machines or hate symbols). Plot owners may also lease or transfer their plot to other players. The full list of rules are explained in the <a href="https://github.com/CivCorp/Legal/blob/master/PlotOwnershipAgreement.md">Plot Ownership Agreement</a>.</p>
              <p>Plots come in three sizes. Central plots are 21x21. Edge plots are 21x19. Corner plots are 19x19. Plots extend from bedrock to sky limit.</p>
          </div>

              <h2>How does CivCorp make money?</h2>
              <p>CivCorp charges monthly dues on its plots, designed to encourage plot owners to put their plots to their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highest_and_best_use">highest and best use</a> and to discourage <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_sprawl">urban sprawl</a>. These dues will increase as the demand for land increases, incentivizing unproductive plot owners to relocate to less valuable locations so that the land can be better utilized. Simultaneously, city dues incentivize CivCorp to reinvest dues into better city services so that demand for land increases. (For fans of economics, our policies were heavily influenced by Milton Friedman and Henry George.)</p>
              <p>CivCorp reassesses plot values monthly and sets dues to roughly equal 1/16th of the assessed value of the plot. However, any increase in dues comes with a corresponding buyout offer; if dues increase by 50%, you can instead sell your plot back to CivCorp for 50% more than you paid. This ensures plot owners can safely invest energy into their plots so long as they believe their use of the plot will remain competitive.</p>

      <h2>Why buy a plot in CivCorp City?</h2>
      <h3>CivCorp is going to invest heavily in the city</h3>
      <p>CivCorp, the corporation that manages CivCorp City, only makes money if we improve the value of plots in our city, so we’re strongly incentivized to invest in making the city a desirable place to live and trade. Some highlights:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A flat grid-based layout facilitates easy navigation and plot labeling.</li>
        <li>The single largest shop and exchange on the server in the center of our city (Plot E5)</li>
        <li>A stamina-backed currency to enable fine-grained trade, with the bank in Plot E4.</li>
        <li>Aqua Nether Portal just 90 seconds away by rail.</li>
        <li>A fully-featured factory room in the center of the city (E5) with Blast Furnace, Advanced Experience Factory, Mithril Tools, Mithril Armor, available for a monthly subscription fee.</li>
        <li>Trench and wall around the city, with guaranteed bounties on any raiders.</li>
        <li>Rail lines connect the city to all major metros.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Plots are an investment</h3>
      <p>CivCorp City plots are an investment. As the value of plots in the city improve over time, you will have the opportunity to sell your plot for more than you bought it, making this one of the few investable opportunities on the server. Also, no new plots will ever be created!</p>
      <h3>Competent leadership</h3>
      <p>CivCorp was founded by MCSPenguin, TheLoneTopWolfx, and Convoy, some of the most experienced traders on any Civ server.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>MCSPenguin, also known as EliteTurtle, opened the Nether Emporium in Olendor and the Purple Shop in Alexandria, and has become one of the most active traders on the server. He likes to design efficient usable spaces and has been terraforming and laying out the city. In real life, he is a software engineer in his mid-twenties.</li>
        <li>TheLoneTopWolfx is a long-time trader on Civ servers, dating back to Devoted 2.0. He spends much of his time thinking about how to build new types of shops and how to make shops more secure (with explanations at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civeconomics/">/r/civeconomics</a>). He built the Civ Mercantile Exchange (CME) in Mt. Augusta, the largest shop on CivClassics. In real life, he is a software engineer in his late-twenties.</li>
        <li>Convoy is the richest player on the server, de facto warden of the server, and owner of the server’s only serious pearl vault.</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>What are the laws of CivCorp City?</h2>
    <p>CivCorp City follows <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CivConcord/comments/48wo6g/civcrafters_law/">CivCrafter Common Law (CCL)</a>:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Do not steal another person’s or entity's digital property.</li>
      <li>Do not destroy another person’s or entity's digital property.</li>
      <li>Do not attack or capture others unless it is in self-defense or in defense of one's digital property.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Failure to observe these laws will result in being banned from the city or being pearled.</p>
    <p>CivCorp officers <em>will</em> pursue lawful bounties. Bounty hunters pursuing lawful bounties are welcome to pursue them in the city.</p>
